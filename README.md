I'm a UX engineer specializing in 3D web technology.

Some of my favorite prototyping tools include
- Three.js
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS

Previously I worked extensively in A-Frame for WebXR experiences, particularly for customizing Mozilla Hubs.

I'm currently helping build a platform for avatar identity at [Hallway](https://joinhallway.com).
