I'm a UX engineer specializing in 3D web technology.

Some of my favorite prototyping tools include
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Effect](https://effect.website/)

Previously I worked extensively in A-Frame for WebXR experiences, particularly for customizing Mozilla Hubs.

I'm currently helping build a creative platform for 3D characters at [Hallway](https://joinhallway.com).
